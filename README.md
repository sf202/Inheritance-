# Inheritance-
You are to write a program with the following:
A super class by the name of Sports.java that will be the base on which to build classess of different sports. The base class must provide
information common to any player regardless of the sports they play such as name number salary.
Now create 3 subclasses for players of your favorite sports such as basketball, soccer, football, tennis etc. In these subclasses put sports
specific information and behavior such as kicking jumping etc.
Now write a client program by the name Driver.java. This will be the main program that will use all of the other classes to test them.
